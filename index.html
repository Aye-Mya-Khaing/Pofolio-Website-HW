    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>PoneNaYeik petal (IxoraCoccinea) and TainPyarTaungNyo leaf (TradescantiaSpathacea) dyes were extracted with acidified solvent, ethanol to study the effects of solvent type on the extraction. UV-vis spectrometer can analyze the optical properties of these natural extract dyes. Characterization results showed high absorbance values 0.5494, 0.5845 and 0.3994 at 450 nm for PoneNaYeik dye. The sharp absorbance values in this study were 1.5244, 1.0997, 1.3577 at 435 nm and 0.9136, 0.6518, 0.7981 at 665 nm for TainPyarTaungNyo. The electrochemical properties of these dyes were observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). These were indicative of the extract can be used as dye sensitized solar cells. Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated the structural properties of these dyes.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>DSSC has been increasingly used because it provides high energy conversion efficiency. [Nurezyanic S et al 2017]. This type of cells exhibits potential for future photovoltaic applications because of its simple fabrication process, low manufacturing cost, low environmental impact, and flexibility. [R. Syafinar et al 2015] Natural dye solar cells are a sub category of organic solar cells. Natural dyes are relatively easy to obtain and extract from plants, fruits, flowers, and leaves, reducing the cost manufacturing of DSSC, as opposed to the production of synthetic dyes. [Zularif  Z  et al 2015] [Michael Grätzel 2003] 
        The natural dyes used in this study were obtained from petals of  red colored IxoraCoccinea (coded as “PNY”), species- I. coccinea , family- Rubiaceae and leaves of TradescantiaSpathacea (coded as “TPTN”), species- T. spathacea, family- Commilinaceae by using ethanol solvent. These plants were found in various places of Myanmar. In this investigation, the samples were collected from Yangon region. The effect on temperature and band gap and molecular energy levels of extracting dyes were investigated systematically by UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry methods. FTIR spectral analysis was used to determine the functional group in the natural dye.

    <p>25g of petals of IxoraCoccinea and 25g leaves of TradescantiaSpathacea, each of one was ground and mixed with 50 mL of 70% ethanol and then stored overnight in the refrigerator at 4°C. On the following day, the extracted samples were stirred using magnetic stirrer at 25°C, 45°C and 65°C for two hours. The procedure continued with the filtration of the samples to remove large residue. Subsequently, the extracts were centrifuged at 4000 rpm using a Denley BS400 (UK) centrifuge machine for five minutes to separate any remaining residues. After that the extracts were placed in a 45–50°C water bath to dissolve more pigments into the extracting solvent.</p>

        <li>2.Characterization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The presence of anthocyanin and chlorophyll pigments in these natural dyes was determined by measuring their absorbance spectra using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan). UV-vis spectroscopy can be used to measure the absorbance of ultra violet or visible light by organic dyes in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm. The functional groups of the sensitizers were determined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 FT-IR).</p>

    <li>3.Cyclic Voltammetry Measurement</li>

<p>Cyclic voltammetry is a very suitable method for a wide range of applications and it is one of the standard techniques used for characterization. [Lucia L et al 2013] It is accomplished with a three electrode arrangement such as a glassy carbon working electrode, platinum counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV/s.
